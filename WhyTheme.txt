The WordPress theme I chose for this particular website is the ‘Corporate Plus’ theme. There are several reasons I chose this theme. 

Reason 1: Clean and Un Cluttered
After reading through the client’s needs I was able to attain that they are looking for a website in which best 
represents themselves and their image. Corporate Plus is able to do this as it offers a clean looking experiences 
with minimal clutter, this allows chalets and caviar to draw the user’s attention directly to where they 
want – Sales and Rent. It also allows this by offering minimal front page options and text 
distractions, prompting the user to the For Sale and For Rent Pages. 

Reason 2: Positioning of Elements
Corporate Plus’s positioning of elements is ideal for the client Chalets and Caviar. The header element is very 
large, spanning almost halfway down the homepage, this header offers a tagline and button right in the center of 
the user’s vision, I opted to change this to a contact button, allowing the user to effortlessly send a message to
 the company, generating potential revenue for the client. The positioning of the sticky nav bar at the top right 
feels natural and clean, so the user is clear what options they have without having to scroll the page. 

Reason 3: Good Media Query CSS
Corporate Plus has good media query CSS implemented already, this ensures that the website still looks good on a
 variety of displays, this reason is crucial in today’s environment of smart phones and tablet computers, especially 
for an e commerce site looking to reach a wide audience.

Reason 4: SEO Ready
This reason is future thought for the client’s needs, having a website that is Search Engine Optimised will
 allow the client to reach a larger audience through higher volumes of traffic and organic ‘hits’, Corporate Plus 
comes SEO ready.
